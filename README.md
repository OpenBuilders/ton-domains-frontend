# TON Domains Bot (Client)

## Disclaimer

This is client side part of TON Domains bot. It was build quite fast, in a hackathon way, to reach MVP asap and bring the value to community. 
We are dreaming to rewrite everything from scratch, but MVP is MVP. 
Don't judge this too hard, better contribute and help this to improve.

## Run the app

*Easy-peasy*. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so two steps to start playing with it:
1. `npm install`
2. Setup your local config `.env.dev`
2. `npm run start` (for development)

As it is Telegram Web App, for the full experience you might need to place this into Telegram:
1. Choose [one of the tunnels](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling) or use your network ip (provided by default after `npm run start`)
2. Put the url from the point above into your bot. Use [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) to configure: Choose your bot -> Bot Settings -> Menu Button -> Configure

## Additional setup

We have no mocks, so the only way to launch the app for now is to also start [backend part](https://github.com/Tonstarter/ton-domains-backend). 

üí° You are welcome to make a PR, adding mocks or even make nobackendblockhainonly app version.

## Contribute

Later on we gonna add dedicated Contribute.md, for now it's enough to stick to these rules:

1. Use conventional commits while adding changes in your PR
2. When making the PR, describe what problem you solve and/or attach an issue
3. Please make it clean, imagine your grandchildren gonna see that code

Stay safe. Let the Lizzard be with you ü¶é
